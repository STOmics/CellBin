## Installation
* Download the [dev branch](https://codeload.github.com/STOmics/StereoCell/zip/refs/heads/dev) in StereoCell repo, and install requirements.txt in a ```python==3.8``` environment.
```text
# python3.8 in conda env
conda create --name=StereoCell python=3.8
conda activate StereoCell
cd StereoCell-dev
pip install -r requirements.txt  # install
```
* The ```pyvips``` package needs to be installed separately. The following is referenced from [pyvips](https://libvips.github.io/pyvips/README.html#non-conda-install)

**On Windows**, first you need to use pip to install like,
```text
$ pip install --user pyvips==2.2.1
```
then you need to download the compiled library from [vips-dev-8.12](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/releases),
To set PATH from within Python, you need something like this at the start:

```python
import os
vipshome = 'c:\\vips-dev-8.7\\bin'
os.environ['PATH'] = vipshome + ';' + os.environ['PATH']
```

**On Linux**,
```text
$ conda install --channel conda-forge pyvips==2.2.1
```
* Download the weight files and transfer them to the specified path (if the path does not exist, you can manually create the new folders).<br>

### Test Data
Here is a mouse brain data set, which is generated by BGI STOmics. 
You only need to download the spatial gene expression data [S200000135TL_D1.gem.gz](https://bgipan.genomics.cn/#/link/HvMV45HgXkseepQo0AoO) (PWD: FMYk) and tiles [SS200000135TL_D1.tif.gz](https://bgipan.genomics.cn/#/link/Jchp46A3HfrTVZymKkRF) (PWD: n2Ge). 
We recommend creating a new "data" folder under StereoCell-dev, and decompressing "SS200000135TL_D1.tif.gz" to this folder. 
"S200000135TL_D1.gem.gz" does not need to be decompressed.<br>

The purpose of open-sourcing this data set is to promote the research of spatial single-cell data in the field of life 
sciences through algorithms. STOmics reserves the right to interpret it.

### Command Line
You can perform StereoCell in one-stop, or perform [image quality control, image stitching, image registration, tissue segmentation, nuclei segmentation, nuclei mask filtering and molecule labeling](docs/modules.md) independently.

StereoCell in one-stop is performed by command:

* ```--tiles_path```  The path of all tiles.
* ```--gene_exp_data``` The compressed file of spatial gene expression data.
* ```--output_path``` The output path.
* ```--chip_no``` Chip number of the Stereo-seq data. 

```shell
cd scripts

# stereocell
python stereocell.py
--tiles_path /data/SS200000135TL_D1
--gene_exp_data /data/SS200000135TL_D1.gem.gz
--output_path /data/result
--chip_no SS200000135TL_D1
```
[More about output](docs/details.md)

### GUI
For some low-quality input data, using the StereoCell pipeline will get wrong results. We have developed a manual tool 
based on [pyqt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) to adapt to this scenario, you can get it through the [cloud disk](https://bgipan.genomics.cn/#/link/qn9MVeFkbSl4i6ULSUvW) (PWD: 6bnz) . 
We have sorted out the details of installation and operation into the [User Manual](docs/CellbinStudio_Manual_20221212.pdf), which will help you get started quickly.
